          <h3>Making the Decision To Switch</h3>
          <p>You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined
            that we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on investment.
            Our goal is to give you as much information as possible to make this determination
            one way or the other. We will provide access to a sandvox of the Canvas application
            for you to get a feel for the platform as well as references to current customers
            to talk about their experience.
          </p>

          <h3>Interfaces and Community Intergration</h3>
          <p>Canvas is meant to integrate with you exisiting interfaces and community
            resources. At a minimum, this means porting over you fax number, enrolling
            you payers with our clearinghouse, and getting bidirectional lab feed running. We'll
            also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that sending
            referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health information
            exchanges or other information technology vendors are important, we will work with you
            to determine what we can deliver and when.
          </p>

          <h3>Data Migration</h3>
          <p>The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current data, which
            we have executed successfully with both remotely hosted and on-premise EMR databases.
            Then our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and information like
            medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward. While importing clinical
            notes and documents is more challenging, out team has been able to do this at a high level of
            fidelity with a wide variety or EMRs.
